					<h2>Starting the Conversation</h2>
					<p>
						It can be difficult to approach a friend you're worried about. The
						key is to come from a place of care and concern, not judgment. Start
						by finding a private, comfortable time to talk. Use "I" statements
						to express your feelings, such as, "I've been worried about you
						lately," rather than accusatory "you" statements.
					</p>

					<h2>Listen Without Judgment</h2>
					<p>
						One of the most powerful things you can do is listen. Allow your
						friend to share their experience without interrupting or offering
						unsolicited advice. Validate their feelings by saying things like,
						"That sounds really difficult." Your goal is to create a safe space
						where they feel heard and understood.
					</p>

					<h2>Encourage, Don't Force</h2>
					<p>
						You can't force someone to seek help, but you can encourage them.
						Offer to help them find resources, such as the campus helpline or a
						local support group. You could say, "Would you be open to talking to
						someone who can help? I can sit with you while you make the call."
						Supporting them in taking the first step can make all the
						difference.
